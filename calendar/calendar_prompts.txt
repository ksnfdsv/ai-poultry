Sure! Here's a fun and whimsical International Museum Day greeting card concept, incorporating your unusual request for two very, very fat roosters and a bottle of oil.
🌍🎨 International Museum Day Greeting Card 🎨🌍

Front of the Card:

    Artwork Concept:
    A grand museum hall illustrated in a stylized, almost surreal way — golden frames, ancient artifacts, and polished floors.
    In the middle of this refined setting, two very, very fat roosters dressed like aristocratic art patrons (tiny glasses, top hats) are dramatically admiring a pedestal display.
    On the pedestal, lit with spotlights, sits... a bottle of oil in a glass case, like it's the Mona Lisa.

    Caption (Front):
    "Celebrate the Treasures of Culture, Curiosity... and Cluck!"

Inside the Card:

    Message:

        On International Museum Day, we honor the guardians of history and imagination.
        Whether it’s fine art or fine poultry, there’s a place for every story.

        Here’s to the collections that make us wonder, laugh, and look closer — even at a humble bottle of oil or a couple of chubby roosters.

        🎉 Long live museums — and the oddities they protect! 🐓🖼️

Here's a fun and quirky concept for a celebration card commemorating the launch of the Mars 2 program on May 19, featuring two fat roosters and a bottle of oil:

🎉 FRONT OF THE CARD (Illustration)

    Setting: A surreal Martian landscape — red sands, craters, and a small Soviet-style satellite dish poking out from a rock.

    Centerpiece: Two extremely plump roosters in full Soviet cosmonaut suits (think bubble helmets and medals), proudly strutting across the surface of Mars.

    One rooster is holding a tiny red flag with the date "May 19" planted on a crater.

    Next to them sits a shiny bottle of oil, glowing slightly as if it's some kind of Martian fuel or victory treasure.

    In the sky, the silhouette of a spacecraft (Mars 2) is zipping across, leaving a smoky trail spelling out:
    "To Mars, With Feathers & Fuel!"

INSIDE THE CARD (Text & Accent Illustration)

    Small doodle of the bottle of oil with wings, flying.

    Message:

        May 19, 1971 – Mars 2 took flight and so did imagination.
        Here's to bold launches, bizarre mascots, and a universe where even fat roosters can reach the stars.

        Celebrate with flair (and maybe a little oil). 🛢️🐓🐓🚀
