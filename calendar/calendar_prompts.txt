Sure! Here's a fun and whimsical International Museum Day greeting card concept, incorporating your unusual request for two very, very fat roosters and a bottle of oil.
🌍🎨 International Museum Day Greeting Card 🎨🌍

Front of the Card:

    Artwork Concept:
    A grand museum hall illustrated in a stylized, almost surreal way — golden frames, ancient artifacts, and polished floors.
    In the middle of this refined setting, two very, very fat roosters dressed like aristocratic art patrons (tiny glasses, top hats) are dramatically admiring a pedestal display.
    On the pedestal, lit with spotlights, sits... a bottle of oil in a glass case, like it's the Mona Lisa.

    Caption (Front):
    "Celebrate the Treasures of Culture, Curiosity... and Cluck!"

Inside the Card:

    Message:

        On International Museum Day, we honor the guardians of history and imagination.
        Whether it’s fine art or fine poultry, there’s a place for every story.

        Here’s to the collections that make us wonder, laugh, and look closer — even at a humble bottle of oil or a couple of chubby roosters.

        🎉 Long live museums — and the oddities they protect! 🐓🖼️

Would you like me to generate a visual version of this card now?
