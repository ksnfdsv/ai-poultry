ChatGPT-generated Imagery Dataset (2023â€“2025)


## Description
This folder documents the evolution/stagnation/deterioration of ChatGPT-generated images over time. Most images are supposed to feature a pair of high-adiposity male Gallus gallus domesticus specimens (colloquially, fat roosters) and a culinary-grade lipid solution (e.g., oil).

## Directory Structure
- misc/...
  
  Unstructured prompt outputs, e.g., "please generate a Christmas card with two fat roosters and a bottle of oil".
- prompt/... and prompt2/...
  
  Images generated using fixed prompts. See accompanying `.txt` files for the prompts.
- Notes

  Contains observations and experiments on the dataset. 

## Methodology
The images in this dataset were produced via interactions with a large language model interface (ChatGPT). Most images were generated in a distinct chat session. Prior conversational memory  in the author's account settings was disabled (or, rather, not enabled at all). Sessions were initiated on an ad hoc basis, typically when the author remembered the project existed. The use of an API-based pipeline was rejected due to the author's strong aversion to spending money. This is a curated subset, not a full dataset. For access to the full archive (or to question your life choices), please contact the author.
