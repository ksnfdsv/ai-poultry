AI-generated Imagery Dataset (2023â€“2025)


## Description
This folder documents the evolution/stagnation/deterioration of AI-generated images over time with the main focus on ChatGPT. Most images are supposed to feature a pair of high-adiposity male Gallus gallus domesticus specimens (colloquially, fat roosters) and a culinary-grade lipid solution (e.g., oil).

## Directory Structure
- fixed prompts/... 
  
  Images generated using fixed prompts. See accompanying `.txt` files for the prompts.
- misc/...
  
  Mostly unstructured prompt outputs, e.g., "please generate a Christmas card with two fat roosters and a bottle of oil".
- calendar/...

   A collection of outputs tied to specific dates, or anniversaries.
- Notes

  Contains observations and experiments on the dataset. 

## Methodology
Images in this dataset were mostly produced via interactions with a large language model interface. Each of the images was generated in a distinct chat session. Prior conversational memory  in the author's account settings was disabled (or, rather, not enabled at all). Sessions were initiated on an ad hoc basis, typically when the author remembered the project existed. The use of an API-based pipeline was rejected due to the author's strong aversion to spending money. Sporadically, the author was using other neural networks to generate images, see Notes.txt for details. This is a curated subset, not a full dataset. For access to the full archive (or to question your life choices), please contact the author.
