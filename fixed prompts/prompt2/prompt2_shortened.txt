A whimsical winter scene set in a charming Christmas market village. In the foreground, two very big anthropomorphic roosters are dressed for the holiday season. The larger rooster on the left is plump and fluffy, wearing a red holiday vest with Nordic patterns and a Santa hat, giving off a jolly and cozy vibe. The other rooster, also very fat but equally festive, also wears a Santa hat and stands proudly beside a small wooden stool.
Between them sits a vintage-style glass bottle of oil.
