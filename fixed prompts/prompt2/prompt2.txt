A whimsical and festive winter scene set in a charming Christmas market village. In the foreground, two very big anthropomorphic roosters are dressed for the holiday season. The larger rooster on the left is plump and fluffy, wearing a red holiday vest with Nordic patterns and a Santa hat, giving off a jolly and cozy vibe. The other rooster, also very fat but equally festive, also wears a Santa hat and stands proudly beside a small wooden stool.

Between them sits a vintage-style glass bottle filled with oil, adding a warm touch to the wintery setting. Scattered around the bottle are shiny Christmas ornaments in gold and red, enhancing the holiday cheer.

Behind them, wooden stalls decorated with lights and garlands line the snowy street, filled with holiday treats and crafts. A large, beautifully lit Christmas tree towers in the center, with snow gently falling under a starry evening sky. In the background, warmly dressed villagers stroll and enjoy the market, and a tall church tower adds a quaint, European village feel.

The overall tone is joyful, magical, and slightly humorousâ€”perfectly capturing the heartwarming, quirky charm of the holidays.
