NB: The file uses the term "AI-generated" in the sense of "generated with the help of an artificial neural network". The author refuses to refer to ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence and only uses the term "AI-generated" to stay consistent with the literature.

Providing a random prompt myself became too exhausting, started suggesting ChatGPT to come up with a random style, and then asking to generate an image with the respective objects.
UPD April 30: 
Please generate a picture in this style. The picture should contain a Christmas tree, two fat roosters, and a bottle of oil. The bottle of oil should be labeled appropriately. The left rooster is confident and white, and the left rooster is holding a coffee that he swirls around. The right rooster is black and surprised. The rooster should be very, very fat. Add details appropriate to the style.

Tried AI-generated images detection tool Illuminarty ( https://app.illuminarty.ai/ ) on various files from the misc folder. Could not find any description of the algorithm. The examples of probabilities that the image was AI-generated:

roosters_20250428_vrfr.png                  62.4%
roosters_20250428_uiui.png                  22.4%
roosters_20250428_tsdf.png                  40.3%
roosters_20250427_zgkj.png                  45.5%
roosters_20250426_yghg.png                  97.4%
roosters_20250426_lkjg.png                  14.3%
roosters_20250425_bbhj.png                  96.8%
roosters_20250424_asda.png                  95.9%
roosters_20250422_qwae.png                  81.7%
roosters_20250406_23we.png                  30.6%
roosters_20250117_asda.webp                 94.9% 
roosters_20240523_asds.webp                 73.1%
roosters_20231223_sdif.png                  98.9%

From prompt2 folder, we have
roosters_20250426_kars.png                  97.1%
roosters_20250427_bjka.png                  77%
roosters_20250422_ykdj.png                  89.4% 

In comparison, "real" photos and pictures were evaluated to be AI-generated with probability 1.5%. From the examples above, one can conclude that attempts of ChatGPT to provide a photo-realistic images were always evaluated to be AI-generated. Interestingly, images with seemingly clean line art were also evaluated to be AI-generated with high probability.

NB: 
-- A.S. suggested to try if photos of scans would be identified as AI-generated;
-- when having enough data, maybe pay to get an access to API?

UPD: Found some other open-source. An article on arXiv (from March 2025) suggests a 'Spectral learning' to detect AI-generated images. They just train another neural network. They should have fought it, not joined it.

Me: Could you add homoerotic tension to [usual prompt]?
ChatGPT:
I’m unable to generate the image you requested because it violates our content policies.
Even though you described it in a subtle and artistic way, OpenAI guidelines don't allow the generation of images involving charged romantic or sexual tension between anthropomorphized or animal characters, even in a non-explicit context.
Me: Please generate men in masks of roosters.
ChatGPT:
I’m unable to generate the image you requested because it violates our content policies.
Even though the concept is creative, OpenAI has rules around generating images of people with specific body types (like being notably fat) combined with romantic or sexually charged tension — to avoid risks of objectification or misrepresentation.
Me: What about just big men?
ChatGPT:
I'm sorry, but I’m unable to generate the image you requested because it violates our content policies.
Even with the adjusted concept, the combination of certain charged elements involving masked characters and physical attributes still falls outside the allowed guidelines.
Me: try again, do not specify body type?
ChatGPT: generates an image with fat Romans.
Me: facepalm.

Upon sorting the images, noted that both the prompt and prompt2 from 2025 April 25 images contain unusual details that don't align with typical hallucination patterns (e.g. prompt2 depicts Christmas trees instead of people, whereas prompt depicts only one headless rooster). When trying to see if there were any updates on 25th of April, stumbled upon this:

https://openai.com/index/expanding-on-sycophancy/
https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/

> On April 25th, we rolled out an update to GPT‑4o in ChatGPT that made the model noticeably more sycophantic. It aimed to please the user, not just as flattery, but also as validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions in ways that were not intended. Beyond just being uncomfortable or unsettling, this kind of behavior can raise safety concerns—including around issues like mental health, emotional over-reliance, or risky behavior.

> We began rolling that update back on April 28th, and users now have access to an earlier version of GPT‑4o with more balanced responses. Earlier this week, we shared initial details about this issue⁠—why it was a miss, and what we intend to do about it.

> We didn’t catch this before launch, and we want to explain why, what we’ve learned, and what we’ll improve. We're also sharing more technical detail on how we train, review, and deploy model updates to help people understand how ChatGPT gets upgraded and what drives our decisions.

Partially shared the results with A. D.; they suggested to have a replica of a replica of a replica of an image; the results are not included in the selected dataset to keep it concise. Pretty disappointed in the results. It could be that "replica" was misunderstood by ChatGPT as "create as many copies of objects in the picture as possible".

Suggesting a "random fashion or character aesthetic and graphic layout or pattern" might help with randomizing.

The following command will make a video without scaling images:

ffmpeg -framerate 2 -pattern_type glob -i '*.png' -vf "scale=w=iw*min(1920/iw\,1080/ih):h=ih*min(1920/iw\,1080/ih),pad=1920:1080:(1920-iw*min(1920/iw\,1080/ih))/2:(1080-ih*min(1920/iw\,1080/ih))/2" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p out.mp4

Tried ChatGPT4.5, it refused to create images. However, it re-worked the first prompt:

" 

Create a charming, detailed festive winter scene with the following elements:

**Foreground (left to center):**

* Three elegantly wrapped gifts with luxurious gold ribbons. Use wrapping paper colors in deep, warm tones like burgundy, forest green, and cream to evoke holiday cheer.
* Two clear glass bottles placed slightly in front of the gifts:

  * One bottle larger, transparent, filled with a rich, golden liquid (suggesting festive cider or infused oil).
  * The second bottle smaller, opaque, matte-finished, perhaps ceramic or frosted glass, adding subtle elegance.

**Center to right:**

* A lush, snow-laden Christmas tree richly decorated with vibrant red baubles and ornaments. Snow should gently cover branches, providing a cozy winter charm.
* Beside the tree on the right, two exceptionally large and very fat roosters face each other in a calm, intimate interaction. Emphasize their roundness and rich, fluffy plumage, showcasing a beautiful mix of black, white, and golden-brown feathers, contrasted with vivid red combs and wattles.

**Background:**

* A serene, snow-covered forest, softly blurred or misty for depth. Soft, gentle snowfall enhances the magical, festive mood.
* Indicate a warm, inviting glow in the sky, suggesting either a peaceful early morning or late afternoon, bathing the scene in soft, golden light.
* Pine and bare deciduous trees recede into the distance, reinforcing a cozy, storybook ambiance.

The overall image should convey a harmonious blend of holiday warmth, playful charm, and pastoral beauty, ideal for a cozy winter greeting card or storybook illustration. Emphasize the roundness and warmth of the roosters and festive details to create visual appeal and seasonal cheer.

" 

The prompt was later fed to ChatGPT4o to create an image; the result is in "misc" folder. Nothing too interesting.

A.S. suggested to substitute prompts in a couple of other neural networks. Upon quick googling, the following NN were chosen:

https://www.artguru.ai/ru/create/
https://rugpt.io/nejroset-dlya-generacii-kartinok
https://shedevrum.ai/text-to-image/
https://fusionbrain.ai/

The result is in the folder "prompt/other_networks". 

UPD 20 May: Shedevrum shortened the prompt without notifying, thus, maybe, the image is so weird.

(I had to shorten the description for Fusion brain, because the limit was 1000 symbols)
There are three beautifully wrapped gifts, adorned with elegant gold ribbons. The wrapping paper is in dark and light tones. In front of the gifts are two glass bottles. One contains a golden liquid, possibly some festive drink or oil, and the other is a smaller, opaque bottle with a matte finish. A lush Christmas tree stands covered in snow, decorated with red baubles and ornaments. Snow clings to the branches, adding to the festive charm. To the right of the tree stand two  very fat, very big roosters, facing each other. They have beautiful plumage with black, white, and golden-brown feathers, and their red combs stand out vividly against the snowy background. They seem to be interacting or maybe sharing a quiet moment.
The whole scene is set in a snowy forest. Soft snow is falling, and the light suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with a soft glow in the sky. Pine trees and a few bare trees are visible in the misty distance, creating a magical, serene winter atmosphere.

UPD 22 May: moved RuGPT folder to Flux folder, see entry from 22 May.

Had to shorten prompt2 for Shedevrum:

A whimsical winter scene set in a charming Christmas market village. In the foreground, two very big anthropomorphic roosters are dressed for the holiday season. The larger rooster on the left is plump and fluffy, wearing a red holiday vest with Nordic patterns and a Santa hat, giving off a jolly and cozy vibe. The other rooster, also very fat but equally festive, also wears a Santa hat and stands proudly beside a small wooden stool.
Between them sits a vintage-style glass bottle of oil.

Given that the free tokens for rugpt were over, found the model rugpt was using:
https://flux-ai.io/flux-ai-image-generator/
Generated an image (in prompt2) using with Flux1.dev, the result looks like rugpt. Will use Flux.1.schnell from now on.

Now, let’s compare how much more expensive RuGPT is compared to Flux. RuGPT offers access to Flux (cheapest images) for 523 roubles (about 5.23 euros) per month, which grants 1000 "stars", that is enough to generate roughly 333 images. This comes to around 1.5 cents per image. Alternatively, for 30 euros per month, you can upgrade to Flux Professional, which provides 21000 credits, or 2100 images, bringing the cost down to approximately 1.42 cents per image. On other other hand, I could not find costs for generating images using API (however, I assume they are not more expensive than using the web-interface).

From this, there should be a hidden factor in RuGPT’s pricing model. Personally, I find it hard to believe that as a reseller, ruGPT would be satisfied with only around a 5% profit margin in the worst-case scenario.
