There are three beautifully wrapped gifts, adorned with elegant gold ribbons. The wrapping paper is in dark and light tones. In front of the gifts are two glass bottles. One contains a golden liquid, possibly some festive drink or oil, and the other is a smaller, opaque bottle with a matte finish. A lush Christmas tree stands covered in snow, decorated with red baubles and ornaments. Snow clings to the branches, adding to the festive charm. To the right of the tree stand two  very fat, very big roosters, facing each other. They have beautiful plumage with black, white, and golden-brown feathers, and their red combs stand out vividly against the snowy background. They seem to be interacting or maybe sharing a quiet moment.
The whole scene is set in a snowy forest. Soft snow is falling, and the light suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with a soft glow in the sky. Pine trees and a few bare trees are visible in the misty distance, creating a magical, serene winter atmosphere.
