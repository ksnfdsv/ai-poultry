Create a festive, colorful greeting card design to celebrate Cook Islands Constitution Day, observed on August 4th. The scene should depict a vibrant tropical island setting with lush palm trees and a sparkling turquoise ocean in the background. Center the composition around two hilariously oversized, plump roosters with bright, multicolored feathers, standing proudly on a sandy beach. Between them, place a gleaming bottle of cooking oil, subtly reflecting the sunlight to symbolize its use in festive island feasts. Include a traditional Cook Islands drum and woven palm decorations to evoke cultural pride. Add bold, cheerful text at the top of the card that reads, “Happy Cook Islands Constitution Day!” in a tropical, bold font. Incorporate small details like scattered seashells and tropical flowers to enhance the celebratory vibe, keeping the roosters as the humorous focal point. Ensure the overall tone is joyful and vibrant, capturing the spirit of this national holiday.
