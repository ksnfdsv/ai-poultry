could you please create an image based on the following prompt:
Two plump, cheerful roosters—one snowy white and one golden—standing proudly side by side on a sunlit farmyard. Between them sits a shiny, ornate bottle of olive oil, shimmering in the sunlight. Above them, an elegant banner reads:
“Celebrating Every Shade of Light – Happy June 13th!”
Inside the Card:
“On International Albinism Awareness Day, we honor the beauty in every kind of light—just like our two feathered friends, vibrant and full of spirit. Here’s to celebrating uniqueness, standing proudly, and pouring kindness into every day (just like that bottle of oil spreads warmth!).”
A small emblem at the bottom shows the two roosters again, each with a drop of oil—symbolizing spreading light and acceptance wherever they go.
