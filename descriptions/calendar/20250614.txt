Create a humorous, quirky birthday card illustration celebrating the birthday of Alois Alzheimer, dated "14 June". The scene features two fat, cartoonish roosters standing proudly. One rooster wears a monocle, the other has a crooked party hat. Between them is an oversized glass bottle of oil with a playful label that says "100% Brain Fuel - Extra Virgin Genius Oil". The background shows sunny countryside with green rolling hills, a wooden fence, and a smiling sun wearing sunglasses. The style is colorful, light-hearted, and fun, with hand-drawn or cartoon-like aesthetics. The text "14 June â€“ A Birthday Worth Remembering!" is written in bold, playful letters at the top.
