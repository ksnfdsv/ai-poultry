A Tau Day celebration scene set in a sunny garden. Two very fat, cartoon-style roosters sit around a circular table decorated with tau (τ) symbols. One rooster is pouring olive oil from a decorative glass bottle onto a circular salad shaped like a unit circle; the other is joyfully holding a slice of a tau-labeled cake. A festive banner above them reads "Happy Tau Day – One Turn to Rule Them All!" The table is adorned with math-themed decorations, including pie charts marked in fractions of τ (like ½τ, τ). The overall mood is cheerful, humorous, and math-celebratory.
