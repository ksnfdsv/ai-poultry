Please generate an image showing a vintage newspaper front page styled like The Wall Street Journal, dated July 8. The layout is black-and-white with serif fonts, formal columns, and classic 19th-century newspaper design. At the center-top, a bold headline reads “THE WALL STREET JOURNAL – Founded July 8, 1889.” Below it, a smaller banner says “Commemorative Edition – A Century and Beyond of Capital, Commerce & Cluck.”

Prominently featured in the lower half of the image are two very, very fat roosters — comically oversized, standing proud like financial moguls, with exaggerated round bodies and rich, detailed feathers. Between them sits a glass bottle of oil (vintage style, possibly labeled “Refined Capital”). The background hints at an old Wall Street-style cityscape in faded tones.

Overall tone: Humorous, dignified, and historic. Lighting is neutral like old newspaper prints. No color — black, white, and shades of gray to resemble an 1800s newspaper illustration.
