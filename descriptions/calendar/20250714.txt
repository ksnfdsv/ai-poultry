Create a hilariously cheerful and vibrant illustration to celebrate Shark Awareness Day on July 14. The scene should prominently feature the text "Shark Awareness Day" and "14 July" in bold, playful, bubble-like letters, either splashed across a bright blue sky or etched into a sandy beach with colorful seashells. Include two very, very fat roosters, absurdly round with comically exaggerated bellies and vibrant, multicolored feathers, waddling on a tropical beach with palm trees swaying in the background. The roosters are wearing oversized, goofy shark-fin sunglasses, adding a ridiculous twist that ties them to the shark theme. One rooster is clutching a giant, shiny bottle of oil labeled "Shark-Shine Oil" with a mischievous wink, as if pitching it for sharks to polish their fins to a dazzling shine. In the background, a group of cheerful sharks is leaping out of a sparkling turquoise ocean, wearing silly party hats and laughing, some holding beach balls for extra fun. The scene should burst with bright, tropical colors, zany energy, and laugh-out-loud humor, emphasizing the absurdly joyful connection between roosters and sharks celebrating together.
