Two very fat, flamboyant roosters are lounging in a cozy barn on a big hay bale couch, watching an old-fashioned color television glowing brightly. One rooster is holding a remote with a wing, while the other has a cupcake smeared across its beak. Surround them with colorful snacks—rainbow corn, jellybeans, and gummy worms. A bottle of oil sits awkwardly between them, half-spilled on the floor. Behind them, a hand-painted sign says:
"June 25 – Color Me Feathered!"
The barn is dim, lit mostly by the glow of the TV, which shows a retro cartoon. Both roosters look proud and overstuffed, feathers poofed out dramatically.
Style: Whimsical, cartoonish, rich in saturated colors, with lots of tiny funny details.
