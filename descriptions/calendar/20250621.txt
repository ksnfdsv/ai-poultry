Please create a humorous yoga-themed greeting card for International Day of Yoga – 21 June. The scene shows two plump, comically fat roosters attempting yoga poses on bright-colored mats in a peaceful sunrise meadow. One rooster is stuck mid-pose, feathers ruffled, looking baffled; the other is triumphantly doing a wobbly tree pose but clearly off-balance.
In the center is a large bottle of "Extra Virgin Rooster Oil" with a smiling cartoon face, giving a thumbs-up like a personal trainer. A speech bubble from the bottle says:

“You stretch, I grease!”

In the sky, written in big playful letters:
"HAPPY INTERNATIONAL DAY OF YOGA – JUNE 21"

Add butterflies doing mini yoga poses in the background for extra silliness.
