Here's a concept for an illustration dedicated to the historic event on May 21, 293—the appointment of Galerius as Caesar under Diocletian, marking the Tetrarchy—with the whimsical and symbolic addition of two very fat roosters and a bottle of oil:
🎨 Illustration Concept: “The Birth of the Tetrarchy – May 21, 293”

Setting:
A grand Roman courtyard in Nicomedia, with classical architecture in the background—pillars, marble steps, and banners in deep red and gold bearing imperial eagles and laurel crowns.

Central Figures:

    Diocletian, wearing a richly decorated imperial purple cloak and laurel crown, stands on the left.

    Maximian, similarly regal, stands beside him on the right.

    Between them, Galerius kneels, being presented with a military cloak (paludamentum) as a sign of being appointed Caesar. A Roman standard (signum) with his name is being raised behind him.

    In the background, Constantius Chlorus (also appointed Caesar later) looks on, hinting at the full vision of the Tetrarchy.

Symbolic Additions:

    Two very fat roosters, heavily stylized and majestic, stand on either side of the group.

        One is perched on a marble plinth, puffed up with pride, representing Diocletian’s dominance in the East.

        The other, on the opposite side, mirrors it, representing Maximian’s control in the West.

        The roosters symbolize vigilance, dawn (a new era), and imperial authority—while their exaggerated girth adds humor and surrealism to the scene.

    A bottle of oil lies at the foot of Galerius, glistening in the sunlight, symbolizing divine anointing, smooth transitions, and strategic lubrication of the empire's governance.

        The bottle might be labeled with Latin: "Oleum Imperii" ("Oil of Empire").

Color and Style:

    Rich earth tones with golden accents.

    Stylized realism with subtle fantastical elements (like slightly exaggerated expressions and the rotund roosters).

    Subtle motifs of the number 4 embedded in the architecture, hinting at the four rulers.

Text Element (optional):
At the top or bottom in Roman script:
“Die XXI Maii, CCCLXXXXIII – Quattuor Reges, Una Roma”
(“May 21, 293 – Four Rulers, One Rome”)

Would you like me to generate this as an image, or help refine it further for a particular style or medium (e.g., comic panel, painting, digital poster)?
