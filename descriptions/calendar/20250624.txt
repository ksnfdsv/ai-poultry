“To commemorate International Fairy Day (June 24), imagine this utterly bonkers scene...

Inside a glitter-strewn woodland clearing, two absolutely gargantuan, plump roosters—so rotund that their tail-feathers sag like overstuffed cushions—are decked out in floral fairy wings. They’re wearing sparkly tiaras and holding tiny wands… but here’s the kicker: they’re locked in synchronized pecking aerobics on a toadstool platform.

Beside them sits a majestic, oversized bottle of golden oil (the fairy-approved kind), labeled: “Wing-Grease Supreme—100% Pixie‑Certified!” One rooster tries to pour a perfect droplet onto its wing, while the other accidentally splashes it across its own freckles of down—all the while whispering fairy gossip and cackling in cock-a-doodle-doo tones.

Above, a constellation of mischievous baby fairies is giggling, pointing, and sprinkling extra fairy dust—just enough to make those roosters wobble in delight. And somewhere in the corner, a tiny elf holds a scoreboard: “Fat Rooster Wing-Grease Olympics: Round 27!”

Write the phrase, add a lot of sparkles and make a dreamcore: 
“24 June! Get ready to flap, cackle, and shine! Happy International Fairy Day—may your wings be greased and your day gloriously bonkers!”
