A colorful, humorous scene celebrating Dinosaur Day on the 2nd of August. In the center, two very fat, comically oversized roosters are proudly posing on a prehistoric jungle stage. They wear tiny party hats and sunglasses, surrounded by ferns and volcanic cliffs. One is holding a bottle of oil like a trophy, the other is perched dramatically on a fossilized dinosaur skull.
Above them, the text "2nd of August" is written in stylized dinosaur bones, like a paleontologist arranged them. In the background, a banner reads:
“We didn’t go extinct… we got plump!”
with a smaller line underneath:
“Roosters: The Chonky Grandkids of T-Rex.”
The whole vibe is absurd, festive, and tongue-in-cheek—like a prehistoric-themed comedy poster. Lush lighting and warm colors.
