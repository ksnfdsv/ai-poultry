Please create an idyllic and relaxing illustration celebrating International Self Care Day (24 July). The scene features two very plump, content-looking roosters lounging peacefully in a tranquil garden or spa-like setting. One rooster is reclining on a soft cushion with cucumber slices over its eyes, while the other is getting a gentle feather massage. Between them sits a beautifully designed bottle of essential oil or massage oil, glowing softly in the warm light.

Surrounding them are soft natural elements—lavender sprigs, smooth pebbles, bamboo leaves, and maybe a tiny teacup of herbal tea. The phrase '24 July' is written in a soothing and creative way—perhaps using flower petals, braided vines, or shaped from warm candlelight or steam from an oil diffuser.

The entire composition should evoke peace, warmth, and gentle humor, capturing the idea of taking time for oneself in a whimsical and heartwarming way. The color palette should be soft and calming—think pastel blues, lavenders, warm creams, and soft greens.
