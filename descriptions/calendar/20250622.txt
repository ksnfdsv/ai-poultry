Please create an illustrated greeting card celebrating World Rainforest Day – June 22. The scene is set in a lush, vibrant rainforest teeming with oversized tropical leaves, parrots, and monkeys peeking through the canopy. In the center are two very fat, smug-looking roosters wearing tiny explorer hats, standing proudly next to a bottle of rainforest oil on a pedestal made of coconuts. One rooster is holding a tiny umbrella like it’s royalty, while the other is showing off a map labeled “Rainforest Real Estate – Cluck Edition.” A cheeky monkey in the background is taking a selfie with the bottle. Big colorful letters above read:
"World Rainforest Day – June 22!"
And at the bottom, in bold comic style:
"Protect the Rainforest… or the roosters will gentrify it!"
