A grand Victorian Gothic Revival church in full view—St Giles Church in Willenhall—captured on the historic day of its formal consecration: 31 July 1867. The church stands tall with pointed arches, decorative stone tracery, stained glass windows glowing with summer sunlight, and a sharply rising spire framed by a dramatic sky. Flying buttresses and creeping ivy enhance the architectural elegance. In the foreground, two very fat roosters stand ceremoniously—one in a tiny Victorian waistcoat, the other wearing a bishop’s mitre askew. Between them sits a radiant bottle of oil, etched with the words “Sanctus Oleum, 31 July 1867”, glowing as though imbued with sacred light. A ribboned banner draped across the church entrance reads:
"St Giles Church in Willenhall – Formal Consecration, 31 July 1867"

Style: painterly realism with gentle magical surrealism
Color palette: warm sandstone, deep greens, antique golds, stained glass hues
Mood: solemn yet whimsical, reverent with a hint of playful charm
