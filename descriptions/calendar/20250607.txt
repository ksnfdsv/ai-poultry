Please create a card based on the following desciption:

Front of the Card:

🎞️ June 7 – VCR Day
Two gloriously plump roosters perch side by side on an old-school VCR, eyeing a gleaming bottle of oil like it’s the remote control to a nostalgic time machine. The TV in the background flickers with static and a grainy 80s sitcom intro.

Inside the Card:

"Rewind the laughs.
Pause the chaos.
Fast-forward to the good times.

Celebrate VCR Day with a little grease, a lot of fluff, and memories worth clucking about."
