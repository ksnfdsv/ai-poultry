please generate the image:  Two extremely plump roosters, their feathers glossy and exaggeratedly full, are perched on either side of a battered bottle labeled “Best Olive Oil – Imported from Spain” (a nod to Leopold Bloom’s breakfast shopping). The roosters gaze knowingly at the viewer, one holding a sprig of parsley in its beak (echoing Bloom’s mutton kidney purchase), the other with a scrap of a Freeman’s Journal tucked under its wing.
    Behind them, a stylized Dublin skyline shimmers like a mirage — the Martello Tower faintly visible in the distance.
    Scattered on the ground: a crumpled flyer for the “Throwaway” horse, a bar of lemon soap, and a pair of spectacles.
