Front of Card — Putrada Ekadashi | 5th August
A dreamlike spiritual landscape at dawn: two majestic roosters perched on either side of a large, glowing bottle of oil, resting atop a sacred lotus-shaped pedestal. The roosters are plump, noble-looking, and oddly serene — their feathers shimmer in soft golden light, with intricate mandala patterns faintly etched into their wings. The bottle of oil appears almost divine: semi-transparent, glowing from within, and sealed with a tiny crown. A subtle golden aura radiates from it.
Around them, elements of Putrada Ekadashi rituals float gently in the air: banana leaves, marigold flowers, earthen oil lamps, and prayer beads. In the sky, celestial patterns of Vishnu symbols swirl among soft clouds. A river of light flows in the background, symbolizing purity and blessings.
Text at the top in elegant Devanagari-inspired calligraphy:
"Putrada Ekadashi – 5th August"
Beneath it, a softer line:
“A day of devotion, blessing, and beautiful oddities.”
Style & Mood:
Whimsical mysticism with elements of Indian folk art and surrealism. Use soft pastels with golden highlights. The scene should feel sacred but also quietly absurd, as if the roosters were holy guardians of the oil bottle — and everyone’s just going along with it.
