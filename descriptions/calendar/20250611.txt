please create an image based on the following description: 

A grand, gilded ballroom, reminiscent of the late 19th century, with chandeliers and marble floors.

Two plump roosters, dressed in comically elegant ballroom attire (bow ties, monocles, tiny waistcoats), are mid-waltz, one dramatically dipping the other. Their feathers are slightly puffed, giving a sense of theatrical flair—Strauss-style.

In the background, a small orchestra of chickens with violins, cellos, and tiny horns.

On a pedestal nearby: a shiny bottle of oil, labeled “Opus 11 – Extra Fine.” It's catching the light like a prized artifact.
