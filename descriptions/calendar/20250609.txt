A vibrant card for Coral Triangle Day on 9 June, featuring a turquoise ocean backdrop with colorful coral reefs. Two plump, playful roosters, decked in snorkeling gear, dance gleefully around a giant bottle of coconut oil labeled "Reef-Safe Shine!" The twist: a cheeky tagline reads, "Cock-a-doodle-doo, save the reefs on June 9 too!" with tiny fish chuckling in the background.
