Please create a festive, colorful card in hyper-realistic style celebrating International Sushi Day that shows the inside of a Japanese restaurant. In the center, two comically fat roosters are dressed like sushi chefs — one wearing a headband that says “Wasabi Warrior” and the other balancing a tray of sushi rolls on its round belly. They stand proudly beside a giant sushi platter that somehow includes fried chicken nigiri.

Beside them, a fancy glass bottle of oil (labeled "100% Organic Chicken Essence") is being uncorked like champagne, with a dramatic pop and oil flying everywhere — instead of confetti, it’s tiny tempura flakes and sesame seeds in the air. One of the roosters is holding chopsticks with its wings, trying to eat sushi but accidentally picking up its own tail feathers.

The background features a cheerful banner that says: “Happy International Sushi Day!” and underneath in bold letters:
"Where East meets Feast... and no chicken is truly safe!"
