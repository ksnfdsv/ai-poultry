Please create a festive, comical digital card styled like a phone screen or chat app. The top reads:
"Happy World Emoji Day – July 17 🎉📅"

Below, show a messenger conversation between two cartoon-style extremely fat roosters represented by exaggerated 🐓 emojis. The roosters are absurdly plump, almost round, and having a dramatic emoji-filled dialogue.

The dialog should be silly, playful, and filled with emojis, such as:

🐓BigChick69: bro… it’s July 17 😳
🐓ThiccFeathers: 😩 time to let the emojis fly
🐓BigChick69: 🐓🐓🐓 + 🛢️ = legendary combo
🐓ThiccFeathers: we oily now 🧴✨
🐓BigChick69: 📅 happy emoji day, my greasy brother

The tone should be chaotic, meme-y, and absurd — like a combination of surreal internet humor and emoji overload. In the background or border, scatter random emojis (🥵🔥💦🎉📱🧠👀) in celebration.

Style: Colorful, bold, meme-core — like a cross between vaporwave aesthetics and sticker-saturated group chats. The roosters are too fat for the screen. The bottle of oil is somehow central, glowing or revered.
