A vibrant, whimsical card celebrating World Oceans Day on 8 June. The scene is set on a sandy beach with a sparkling turquoise ocean in the background, waves gently lapping at the shore. Two chubby, playful roosters, decked out in tiny Hawaiian shirts, strut proudly across the sand, each holding one end of a comically oversized bottle of olive oil in their beaks. The bottle has a label that reads, “Oil for the Land, Not the Sea!”—a cheeky nod to keeping oceans free from pollution. Above them, the phrase “8 June” is written in bold, bubbly letters formed by colorful seashells. A mischievous seagull perches atop the oil bottle, winking at the viewer, adding a humorous twist. The card’s message inside reads: “Celebrate World Oceans Day—keep our seas clucking clean!”
