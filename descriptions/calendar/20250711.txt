Create a vibrant, whimsical illustration set in a 1960s small-town Southern courtyard, bathed in warm summer light. In the center, two comically plump roosters, feathers puffed up proudly, stand on a rustic wooden table, each holding a copy of To Kill a Mockingbird with their wings. One rooster sports a tiny straw hat, the other a bow tie, both grinning mischievously. Next to them, a shiny bottle of cooking oil gleams, with a label that cheekily reads 'Mockingbird Moonshine Oil.' The fun twist: the roosters are hosting a lively book club party, with colorful streamers, a jukebox playing 1960s tunes, and a banner overhead that says 'Cluckinâ€™ Good Read 1960!' Scattered around are open books, magnolia flowers, and a few curious chickens peeking at the celebration. The scene is joyful, quirky, and full of Southern charm.
