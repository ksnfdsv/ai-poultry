28 May 585 BC â€“ A solar eclipse occurs, as predicted by the Greek philosopher and scientist Thales, while Alyattes is battling Cyaxares in the Battle of the Eclipse, leading to a truce. This is one of the cardinal dates from which other dates can be calculated. It is also the earliest event of which the precise date is known. 
Could you please create a card celebrating this event? The card should also include two very fat roosters and a bottle of oil. Add details related to the eclipse of Thales. It should be written "28 May".
