Create a vibrant, humorous illustration for World Kiss Day on 6 July. The scene features two very fat, colorful roosters with fluffy feathers, comically puckering up as if about to kiss, but with exaggerated, nervous expressions as they realize they're covered in slippery oil from a shiny bottle of oil tipped over between them, creating a glossy, comedic mess. The bottle, prominently placed, has a cheeky label that reads 'Extra Slippery!' The roosters are sliding slightly toward each other on a puddle of oil, with rose petals and tiny hearts floating around for a romantic vibe. The background is soft pastel with sparkles for a playful contrast. Above the roosters, include bold, elegant cursive text that reads '6 July' and 'World Kiss Day,' surrounded by small hearts. The overall mood is lighthearted, absurdly funny, and celebratory, emphasizing the quirky, slippery twist of their almost-kiss.
