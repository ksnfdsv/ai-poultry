🎉 WORLD BICYCLE DAY 🚲
June 3 — the day humanity pedals with pride... and poultry.

Two fat roosters in aviator goggles straddle tiny bicycles, their fluffy tail feathers flapping dramatically in the wind. One rooster holds a triumphant wing in the air. The other? Balancing a suspiciously shiny bottle of oil, labeled: "100% Organic Chicken Grease – for chains & charm."

Inside the Card:
They said roosters couldn’t ride bikes.
They were wrong.
They said bikes don’t need oil made from poultry.
They were also wrong.
Today, we honor the brave, the bold, and the bizarre.
Happy World Bicycle Day!
Pedal hard, oil often, and never underestimate a fat bird on a mission. 🐓💨
