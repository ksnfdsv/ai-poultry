Holiday: National Cheesecake Day (celebrated on July 30)
Card Concept: A playful, indulgent greeting card celebrating National Cheesecake Day, featuring two extremely fat roosters and a bottle of oil in a whimsical, dessert-themed scene.
Visual Description:
The card’s front showcases a vibrant, cartoon-style illustration of two hilariously plump roosters, their feathers fluffed and bellies round, lounging on a cozy bakery counter. They’re surrounded by creamy cheesecakes topped with berries and drizzles. A gleaming bottle of oil, labeled “Silky Crust Oil,” sits proudly in the foreground, catching the light. One rooster wears a tiny baker’s apron, comically tight, while the other holds a fork with a mischievous grin. The background features a pastel-colored bakery with cheesecake slices stacked high, confetti, and a festive “Happy Cheesecake Day!” banner.
