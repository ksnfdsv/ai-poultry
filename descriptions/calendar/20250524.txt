Could you please make a concept for a card that celebrates Asparagus Day, and has in it two very, very fat roosters as well as oil?

Sure! Here's a fun and quirky concept for your Asparagus Day card featuring two very, very fat roosters and oil:

Front of Card:
Illustration:

A lush spring field with bright green asparagus stalks growing in neat rows.

In the center, two absurdly plump roosters strut proudly through the field. They're comically round—almost ball-shaped—but still manage to look regal.

One rooster wears a little chef's hat; the other has a napkin tied around its neck.

Off to the side, a bottle of olive oil sparkles in the sun, glistening with a golden hue, and a few asparagus spears are drizzled with it like fine cuisine.

Text (in playful, curly script):

"Happy Asparagus Day!
A celebration of greens, oils... and poultry with presence."

Inside of Card:
Left Side (Illustration):

The two roosters are now lounging in reclining lawn chairs with sunglasses on, dipping roasted asparagus spears into little ramekins of flavored oil like they’re at a spa.

Right Side (Text):

"May your Asparagus Day be rich, green, and gloriously greasy!

Whether you steam it, roast it, or dress it in oil,
don't forget to strut your stuff—just like these birds!"

(Also, maybe go easy on the oil... or you'll end up as plump as these two.)
