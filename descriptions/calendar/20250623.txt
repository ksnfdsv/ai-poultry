Please create an illustrated greeting card for United Nations Public Service Day – June 23. The scene shows two fat, pompous roosters wearing tiny suits and sunglasses, proudly strutting across a government office desk like they own the place. Between them is a fancy bottle of cooking oil labeled “100% Bureaucratic Grease – Extra Slick Edition.” One rooster is stamping papers with exaggerated flair, while the other is dramatically answering a rotary phone, saying, “Yes Minister, the oil is... under control.” Confetti is falling in the background, and a banner reads: “June 23 – Celebrating United Nations Public Service Day!” The style is colorful, cartoonish, and cheeky, with over-the-top expressions and props.
