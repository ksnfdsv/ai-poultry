Create a dignified, realistic illustration for Cross Atlantic Communication Day, celebrated on July 27th. Depict two very, very fat roosters standing solemnly on opposite sides of a detailed Atlantic Ocean, each holding a vintage telegraph device to symbolize communication across the sea. The roosters are robust, with meticulously detailed feathers in natural tones, exuding strength and presence. Between them, a large, intricately designed bottle of oil hovers above the ocean waves, radiating a subtle glow to represent the facilitation of seamless communication. The ocean is rendered with realistic, deep blue waves, and in the background, a serene sunrise connects the horizons, symbolizing unity. Include faint outlines of North America and Europe on either side to emphasize the cross-Atlantic theme. Prominently display the text 'Cross Atlantic Communication Day' and 'July 27th' in elegant, bold typography above the scene. Incorporate telegraph wires stretching across the sky for added context. The overall tone is formal, majestic, and celebratory, using rich, grounded colors to convey importance and connection.
