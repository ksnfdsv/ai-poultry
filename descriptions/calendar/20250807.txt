Create a richly colored greeting‑card scene for 7th August – Battle of Boyacá Day. Center two proud, proud roosters facing slightly inward, as if standing guard. Between or just in front of them, place a classic glass bottle of oil (olive or another traditional option), its label stylized with a faint Colombian flag motif. Use bold, warm tones—deep reds, vibrant yellows, and blues—for the color palette. Make the setting feel ceremonial and hopeful.
