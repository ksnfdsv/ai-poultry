Please create a hilariously absurd greeting card for International Asteroid Day – June 20 (the date is clearly written in bold, glittery space-font at the top). The scene shows two ridiculously fat roosters in tight, stretched-out space suits floating on a small asteroid shaped like a chicken drumstick. One rooster clutches a giant, glowing bottle of cooking oil labeled “Premium Meteor Marinade”. The other is looking horrified and yelling: “We’re supposed to be monitoring asteroids, not marinating them!”

Meanwhile, in the background, a flying saucer full of clucking alien chickens is filming the scene for a space reality show called "Coopocalypse Now!" A frying pan-shaped moon orbits in the distance with sizzling sound effects written in comic-style letters: "SZZZZZZ!"

At the bottom of the card:
“Prepare your poultry... Asteroid Day is coming!”
