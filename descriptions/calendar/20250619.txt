Please create a greeting card celebrating World Sauntering Day – June 19. The scene shows two plump, flamboyant roosters strutting down a country dirt path like runway models, each wearing tiny sunglasses and silk scarves blowing in the breeze. One rooster carries a bottle of olive oil under its wing like a briefcase. The label on the bottle reads: "100% Swagger Grease." Behind them, a shocked farmer and confused cows look on. A wooden sign in the background says “Saunter Responsibly – It’s June 19!”. The whole scene is bathed in warm afternoon light, with a sparkly, over-the-top glamour filter, as if it's a cologne ad. Include text at the top: “Waddle with Style – It’s World Sauntering Day!”
