Create an image dedicated to celebrating Chocolate Day with a whimsical, chocolate-drenched feast! Two very, very fat roosters—both entirely covered in thick, glossy melted chocolate (one like a living fondue fountain, the other smugly sipping from a chocolate-coated bottle of oil labeled '100% Cocoa OIL')—sit atop a giant, gooey chocolate cake. Every single object in the scene is smothered in chocolate: the cake, the roosters, the bottle, even the air seems syrupy. The background is a surreal chocolate wonderland with dripping chocolate waterfalls, oversized chocolate bars, and clouds made of whipped chocolate mousse. One rooster tries to balance a chocolate truffle (also chocolate-covered, of course) on its beak, while the other, wearing a tiny chocolate chef’s hat, is attempting (and failing) to sculpt a chocolate statue of itself from melting fudge. Floating above it all, in gooey grandeur, is the phrase '7th of July' spelled out in puffy marshmallows, also partially dipped in chocolate. The scene is absurd, messy, sticky, and delicious—a playful tribute to total chocolatey chaos and ridiculous poultry pride.
