In 1896, Guglielmo Marconi applies for a patent for his wireless telegraph. Please create a card celebrating 2nd of June. The card should include two very fat roosters and a bottle of oil. Maybe, they should talk over a telegraph about the bottle of oil? Add text to show it is a card to celebrate the event.
