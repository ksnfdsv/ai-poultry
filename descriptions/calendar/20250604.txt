A whimsical, vintage-style illustration with muted, parchment-toned colors and fine ink lines. In the center, a large, patchwork hot air balloon (the Montgolfière) floats a few feet off the ground. The balloon is festooned with 18th-century French flourishes—ribbons, tassels, and a slightly singed banner reading "Vive la Science!"

Perched confidently on the balloon’s rim are two outrageously fat roosters, feathers puffed, chests out, each wearing a tiny powdered wig and a monocle. One rooster has a little French tricolor sash; the other is reclining like a Roman emperor. Both look far too smug to fly.

Between them sits a bottle of oil, tilted into a saucer as if it's a fine wine. One rooster is daintily dipping a wingtip into it.

Below, the Montgolfier brothers (drawn like eccentric inventors in ruffled shirts and wild hair) are staring up in frustration—one with a spyglass, the other with a wrench. Smoke curls lazily from the balloon’s burner, but the balloon is visibly straining under the weight of the roosters.

In the background, curious 18th-century villagers (some holding baguettes, one eating cheese) watch with a mix of awe and confusion. A child points excitedly at the scene, and a small dog barks at the balloon.

Above it all, curly text reads:
“ON THIS GLORIOUS 4TH OF JUNE…”
