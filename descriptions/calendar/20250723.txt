Depict a cosmic celebration of July 23, 2015 — the day NASA announced the discovery of Kepler-452b, Earth's "older cousin" planet, found by the Kepler space telescope.
In the scene, show two hilariously fat roosters floating weightlessly inside a retro-futuristic space capsule labeled “Cluck-452.” They’re decked out in puffy space suits with custom helmet holes for their combs, clumsily pecking at glowing control panels labeled "EXO-PLANET DETECTION".
One rooster is proudly holding a scroll that reads "KEPLER-452B FOUND!" while the other clutches a golden bottle of “Interstellar Oil – 100% Dark Matter-Free” floating next to them.
Through the window, the viewer can see Kepler-452b, which looks like Earth’s classy older sibling — complete with rings and a fancy top hat hovering above it.
Add a mission patch floating in zero-G that reads:
“July 23, 2015 – One Giant Leap for Roosterkind”
Bonus detail: a floating snack pouch labeled “Freeze-Dried Corn” and a warning sticker on the console:
“CAUTION: Oil and feathers do not mix in zero gravity.”
