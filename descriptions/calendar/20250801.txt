A lively digital scene glows under a pixelated sunrise, celebrating World Wide Web Day on August 1st. Two hilariously chubby roosters, decked out in neon-colored feather patterns, waddle across a grid-like "web" of glowing blue lines, mimicking internet connections. One rooster sports tiny VR goggles, while the other balances a shiny bottle of olive oil on its wing, wrapped with a binary-code ribbon (101010). Above them, a retro browser window pops up with bold text: “Happy World Wide Web Day – August 1st!” in a classic 8-bit font. Tiny pixelated icons of globes, links, and Wi-Fi signals bounce around the borders.
“Surf’s up on World Wide Web Day, August 1st! Let’s crow about the connections that bring us together online. May your day be smooth as olive oil and packed with digital delights!”
Below, a doodle shows the roosters video-chatting on laptops, each sipping from a tiny oil bottle, with speech bubbles saying “Cluck the Web!”
A minimalist pixel globe with the text: “Designed for World Wide Web Day, August 1st. Connect, create, celebrate!”
