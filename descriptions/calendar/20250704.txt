Please create the following image. This illustration is a whimsical tribute to Alice in Wonderland Day, celebrated on 4 July. The scene unfolds in a lush, surreal Wonderland clearing—filled with giant mushrooms, curling vines, and warped checkerboard paths.

At the center are two very fat roosters, hilariously overdressed in shabby Victorian waistcoats, top hats, and monocles. They stand on either side of a mushroom pedestal, locked in a ridiculous standoff over a glowing bottle of oil labeled “Drink Me Not (Probably)”. A single golden drop escapes the bottle, causing the grass below to twist into something bizarre—perhaps a sprouting teacup or a miniature chessboard.

The entire scene is infused with Wonderland absurdity: floating playing cards, a sideways teapot pouring into a hat, and signs pointing nowhere. The sky is streaked with soft pastels, giving the image a dreamlike haze.
Text in the Illustration:

    “Alice in Wonderland Day” should appear prominently, styled in a playful, curving type—perhaps floating in the air like part of the landscape.

    “4 July” must be included visually—etched into a tree, stitched onto one of the rooster’s coats, or written on a hanging sign—clearly marking the date.

The final tone is nonsensical, magical, and celebratory—a proper Wonderland tribute to 4 July and all things curious.
