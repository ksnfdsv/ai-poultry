Please create a concept of an illustration that celebrates 20th of may, World Bee Day. The picture should include two very fat roosters and a bottle of oil. They don't have to be the center of the composition, though.

Here's a creative and whimsical concept for your World Bee Day illustration that incorporates two very fat roosters and a bottle of oil, without making them the central focus:
Illustration Concept: “The Buzzing Garden Banquet”

Scene Description:

    Setting: A lush, blooming meadow garden bathed in warm late-spring light. Flowers of all colors are bursting with life—lavender, sunflowers, daisies, and clover fill the scene. Bees are everywhere: buzzing in midair, clustering around blossoms, and carrying pollen back to hives in the distance.

    Main Focus:
    A large, ornately decorated bee-themed picnic table is the centerpiece. It's covered with honey jars, pollen cakes, and wildflower arrangements. Bees are joyfully swarming around, sipping from flower nectar cups. Tiny banners read "Happy World Bee Day!"

    The Roosters:
    Off to one side (right or left foreground), two comically fat roosters sit lazily in the grass. They're clearly not part of the bee celebration and look hilariously out of place—plump, smug, feathers fluffed, each with a little crown of daisies on their heads. One is eyeing a flower suspiciously, while the other is trying to peck at a stray honeycomb with little success.

    The Bottle of Oil:
    Resting between the roosters is a vintage glass bottle of sunflower oil—perhaps a subtle nod to the garden's bounty. It’s partially tipped, with some golden oil glistening at the neck. One of the roosters has a greasy feather, as if it’s gotten a bit too curious.

    Background Elements:
    In the background, you can include bee hives (natural or man-made), some flying insects, a squirrel playing a flute (optional touch of whimsy), and children or forest creatures observing quietly in awe of the bees’ dance.

    Color Palette:
    Warm golds, honey yellows, vibrant greens, and floral pastels to give it a celebratory, sun-drenched atmosphere.

Would you like me to turn this concept into a visual image? Or adjust it to lean more surreal, realistic, or humorous?
