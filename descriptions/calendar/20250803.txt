Create a whimsical holiday card celebrating "TRS-80 Day" on August 3.
The scene includes two fat, cartoon-style roosters with exaggerated, nerdy features (like glasses or headsets), standing proudly next to a vintage TRS-80 computer on a desk.
A bottle of oil (labeled "Rooster Booster" or "CPU Lube") is sitting on the desk beside them, adding a quirky, humorous touch.
The style should be colorful and fun, like a greeting card or retro comic book cover. Include the text:
"Happy TRS-80 Day â€“ Keep Your Circuits Oiled and Your Roosters Fat!"
