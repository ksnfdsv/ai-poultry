🐈‍⬛🌿 Greeting Card Prompt: International Cat Day – 8 August 🌿🐈‍⬛
Style: Cozy cottagegore, soft golden light, pastoral whimsy

Front of Card – Illustration Prompt:
A warm, sun-dappled cottage garden at golden hour.

A chunky, sleepy tabby cat lies curled on a weathered windowsill, paws tucked in, eyes half-lidded with contentment.

On the cobblestone path below, two immensely fat roosters—round as pumpkins—sit in a nest of moss and clover. Their feathers are fluffy and a bit ruffled, as if they’ve been napping too.

Between them, nestled like a treasure: a bottle of golden oil, shaped like an old apothecary flask, catching the last rays of sunlight.

Ivy crawls over the edges of the scene. Dried herbs hang from the rafters.

Written in soft, hand-lettered script across the top:
“8 August — International Cat Day”

Inside Text – Cozy Cottagecore Message:

In the gentle stillness of an August afternoon,
the cat reigns from her windowsill throne,
while the roosters rest, round and serene,
guarding the sacred bottle of oil—
that ancient elixir of coziness and calm.

May your day be filled with naps, soft fur,
plump friends, and sun-warmed magic.

Happy International Cat Day
(from the whole cottage crew)
