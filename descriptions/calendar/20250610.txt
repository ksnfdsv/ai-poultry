On an elegant Art Nouveau-themed card, two extravagantly plump roosters stand proudly—one with a flamboyant, curled tail of peacock-like feathers and the other perched next to an ornate bottle of oil, shaped like a vintage perfume decanter. The roosters are covered in swirling decorative plumage, echoing the flowing lines and floral patterns of Alphonse Mucha's work. Vines curl around the frame, interspersed with stylized sunflowers, lilies, and irises.

A gilded, flowing Art Nouveau font spells out:

“10th of June – World Art Nouveau Day”
(Celebrating curves, curls, and clucks!)

Beneath, in a ribbon-like banner with golden accents:

🐓 “Get plump with style – it’s A La Mode Nouveau!” 🐓

The whole card should feel like a blend of vintage elegance and absurd poultry glamor.
