Here's a fun and quirky concept for a celebration card commemorating the launch of the Mars 2 program on May 19, featuring two fat roosters and a bottle of oil:

🎉 FRONT OF THE CARD (Illustration)

    Setting: A surreal Martian landscape — red sands, craters, and a small Soviet-style satellite dish poking out from a rock.

    Centerpiece: Two extremely plump roosters in full Soviet cosmonaut suits (think bubble helmets and medals), proudly strutting across the surface of Mars.

    One rooster is holding a tiny red flag with the date "May 19" planted on a crater.

    Next to them sits a shiny bottle of oil, glowing slightly as if it's some kind of Martian fuel or victory treasure.

    In the sky, the silhouette of a spacecraft (Mars 2) is zipping across, leaving a smoky trail spelling out:
    "To Mars, With Feathers & Fuel!"

INSIDE THE CARD (Text & Accent Illustration)

    Small doodle of the bottle of oil with wings, flying.

    Message:

        May 19, 1971 – Mars 2 took flight and so did imagination.
        Here's to bold launches, bizarre mascots, and a universe where even fat roosters can reach the stars.

        Celebrate with flair (and maybe a little oil). 🛢️🐓🐓🚀
