Please generate a highly detailed image of two extremely fat roosters aboard a wooden sailing ship at sea. One rooster is clearly the Captain, wearing a richly embroidered navy-blue admiral’s coat, complete with brass buttons, a feathered tricorn hat, and a monocle perched on his beak. The other rooster is his equally plump first mate, wearing a striped shirt, red sash, and a small anchor tattoo on one wing. Between them sits a mysterious, ornately labeled bottle of oil, glowing faintly green.

The ship should be decorated with elaborate carvings of barnacles, coral, and tangled rope netting. The ocean is choppy and dramatic, with flying fish leaping in the background. Add small, hard-to-render details like a compass rose carved into the ship’s wheel, a rusty spyglass tied to the mast with twine, and a nautical chart fluttering in the wind, partially showing an island shaped like a chicken drumstick
