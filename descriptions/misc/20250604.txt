Card Title: Neon Bloom: Dance of the Paper Sky

Description:

In the pulsating heart of Neo-Kyoto, beneath a sky stitched with circuitry and sakura blossoms glowing in bioluminescent pink, the ancient art of origami comes alive in a breathtaking rebellion against chrome conformity. Hovering cranes and folded foxes flit through the air, their edges lined with flickering LED veins.

Amid the digital petals drift two outrageously fat cyber-roosters—feathered behemoths modified with micro-reactors in their bellies, their plumage a riot of neon plumes and chrome scales. They strut with absurd grace, guarding a sacred glass bottle filled with golden synth-oil, a relic from the old world, now used to anoint origami offerings before the Sakura Core—a digital deity born from code and tradition.

This card is a surreal celebration of duality: delicate folds and heavyweight guardians, natural beauty and tech-saturated wonder. It’s a reminder that even in the age of augmented reality, paper, petals, and poultry can still steal the spotlight.
