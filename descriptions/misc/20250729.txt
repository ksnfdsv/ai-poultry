Please draw as if it was a manga page:
[Full-page panel, dynamic tropical setting]
Scene: A luxurious yacht bobs gently in the crystal-clear waters of a tropical sea. In the background, a lush island rises with palm trees swaying and clouds drifting lazily in the bright sky.
Foreground (Left): A comically plump rooster stands proudly at the helm, dressed in an exaggerated captain’s uniform—complete with a tiny hat, golden epaulets, and a smug expression. His round body barely fits behind the wheel.
Foreground (Right): Another overweight rooster waddles toward the yacht’s edge, wearing an over-the-top scuba diving suit, flippers and all, adjusting his goggles with serious determination.
Deck detail: A suspicious-looking bottle of oil lies casually on the deck between them, catching a glint of sun.
Caption (in manga-style narration box):
"In the heart of the tropics... two legendary birds set sail for glory—and possibly lunch."
