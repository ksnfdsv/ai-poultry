An 8-bit arcade game level set on a floating pirate ship surrounded by a tropical sea. Two fat pixelated roosters dressed as pirate captains stand on opposite sides of the ship’s deck—one with a pixelated eyepatch and feathered hat, the other with a red bandana and tiny cutlass. Between them is a pixel-art bottle of glowing oil hovering slightly like a power-up item. The ocean below is vibrant turquoise with blocky waves, and small pixelated palm islands dot the background. The sky is a looping gradient of purple and orange, with chunky 8-bit seagulls flying past. The scene includes game UI elements: hearts in the top corner, a “Score: 00750” bar, and floating gold coins above barrels. The overall style mimics classic NES or SNES games, quirky and colorful.
