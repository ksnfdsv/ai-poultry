Picture two exceptionally portly roosters kicking back in style by a swimming pool. They're both sporting trendy sunglasses and leisurely sipping cocktails, surrounded by playful animal inflatables in the water. The sunlight creates distinct caustics that dance on the pool's surface and the surrounding area. Between them rests a large, conspicuously placed bottle of oil, with one rooster patting his very full belly contentedly, while the other wipes a greasy beak, clearly hinting at the oil's recent use in a perhaps unconventional (and un-rooster-like) feast.
