Front of the Card:
Two gloriously plump roosters—one white with a flamboyant red comb, the other golden with a smug expression—strut dramatically under a canopy of pink cherry blossoms in full bloom. Between them sits a glistening bottle of sesame oil, wrapped in an intricate origami crane made of washi paper, as if it's some kind of sacred offering. Cherry petals float lazily around them like confetti. A Japanese temple peeks from the background.

Inside the Card:
The scene zooms in: the roosters are clearly in the middle of a high-stakes cooking show filmed on location in Kyoto. A tiny camera crew of origami frogs is hard at work. The bottle of oil? It's the secret ingredient.

The twist?
The white rooster dramatically flips the bottle open with a wing… and out pops a message:

"Congratulations! You’ve just won a lifetime supply of tempura batter and a vacation in Okinawa—with these two as your personal chefs. Hope you don’t mind feathers in your food!"

Tagline at the bottom:
"Cherry blossoms, culinary chaos, and clucking comedy—only in Japan!"
