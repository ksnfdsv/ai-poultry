Scene Description:
The card bursts with the delicate beauty of cherry blossoms in full bloom, their soft pink petals fluttering against a serene blue sky. In the foreground, two comically plump roosters with absurdly long, flowing tails strut proudly across a lush green meadow. Their feathers shimmer with iridescent hues, making them look like they’ve escaped from a flamboyant parade. Each rooster sports a tiny origami cherry blossom crown, slightly askew, adding to their goofy charm.

To the left, a sleek katana is dramatically plunged into the ground, its hilt wrapped in cherry blossom-patterned silk. Next to it, a bottle of glistening cooking oil sits inexplicably, with a small origami crane perched on its cap, as if guarding it. The oil bottle has a label that reads “Rooster’s Finest Feather Shine” in playful calligraphy, hinting at the roosters’ secret to their lustrous tails.

Funny Twist:
In the background, one rogue cherry blossom petal has landed on the katana’s blade, and it’s comically “stuck” there, causing the roosters to pause mid-strut and glare at it with exaggerated confusion. One rooster has a speech bubble above its head saying, “Who dared mess with our vibe?!” The absurdity of these pompous roosters being offended by a single petal adds a lighthearted, whimsical touch to the scene.

The card’s border is adorned with delicate origami cherry blossoms, tying the elements together in a harmonious, humorous celebration of springtime and quirky rooster pride.
