Create an abstract, painterly illustration in the spirit of Suprematism, infused with a playful pirate theme:
Two stout, stylized roosters occupy a fragmented, geometric interpretation of a pirate ship's wooden deck. Their forms are abstracted—plump bodies rendered with vivid, intersecting planes of color, angular yet expressive. One rooster bears a minimalist symbol of a pirate hat and a slashed circle suggesting an eye patch; the other, a diagonal band of red evoking a bandana.

Between them rests a bold, textured shape representing a bottle of oil—its surface catching light through stark contrast and simplified reflections, topped with a cork suggested through form rather than detail. The surrounding sea is conveyed through rhythmic, sweeping arcs and layered color blocks, with a distant triangular island under a radiant, square or circular sun.

Emphasize geometric balance, emotional tension, and the raw energy of painterly brushstrokes. Use a limited but striking color palette, and allow abstraction to lead over representation—evoking the feeling of a pirate tale more than illustrating it literally.
