Two hyper-masculine roosters as gritty pirates, standing on the deck of a weathered ship at sunset. Both roosters are muscular, anthropomorphized with exaggerated gym physiques — bulging biceps, feathered chests glistening with oil from a prominently placed bottle labeled "Rooster Oil™". They're wearing torn pirate pants, open vests, heavy boots, and leather belts with gold buckles. One has an eyepatch and grips a cutlass, the other smokes a cigar and flexes. Their intense gaze reflects unspoken rivalry — "mann gegen mann" energy. The aesthetic blends dark gachi themes with hyperrealism: dramatic lighting, sweat, oil sheen, stormy sky. Background hints at a gym below deck with barbells and chains. Bold, raw, and unapologetically masculine.
