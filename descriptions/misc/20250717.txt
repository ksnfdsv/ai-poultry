Create a vibrant, whimsical summer scene in the style of a colorful, surrealist cartoon. Two extraordinarily plump roosters, each lounging on bright, animal-shaped pool inflatables—one a pink flamingo, the other a blue dolphin—are floating lazily in a sparkling swimming pool under a blazing sun. The roosters are playfully splashing water at each other, feathers ruffled from the fun. Nearby, a shiny bottle of golden oil floats gently on a lily pad inflatable.

For a funny moment: One rooster accidentally squirts oil from the bottle, slicking its feathers, and starts slipping and sliding around on the inflatable like it's on a tiny water slide—causing both roosters to burst into amused clucks.

For a sad moment: In the corner of the pool, a small rubber duck inflatable slowly deflates, drooping sadly as the roosters continue their fun, unaware of its slow goodbye.
