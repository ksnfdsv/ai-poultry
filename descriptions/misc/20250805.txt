Two extremely fat roosters dressed as flamboyant pirates, with exaggerated feathery coats, tattered tricorne hats, and belts overflowing with tiny cutlasses and gold coins. One rooster has a peg leg made from a corncob, the other wears an eyepatch made from a cracked eggshell. Between them stands a large anthropomorphic bottle of oil, also dressed as a pirate â€” complete with a sash, hook, and beady glass eyes, oozing a slick trail behind it. The trio stands aboard a surreal, slightly melted-looking pirate ship made of driftwood and kitchen utensils, sailing through a sea of bubbling gravy under a sky swirling with neon clouds and giant floating chicken nuggets. The lighting is dramatic and painterly, like a Renaissance oil painting mixed with vaporwave tones.
