A highly detailed, top-down aerial view of two extremely overweight roosters lounging beside a luxurious backyard swimming pool. The roosters have exaggeratedly plump bodies, with iridescent feathers puffed out in hues of deep crimson, bronze, and emerald, casting complex shadows on the pale stone tiles. One rooster is sprawled lazily on a pool chair with its wings hanging down, while the other perches on the edge of the pool, causing visible tension in the tiles beneath due to its size. Between them, an absurdly oversized glass bottle of golden cooking oil (at least 3 feet tall) stands upright, catching sharp reflections from the midday sun. The label on the bottle is ornate, vintage-style, partially peeling, with unreadable text in a serif typeface. The water in the pool is crystal-clear with intricate ripples and refractions, and the scene includes detailed poolside elements like scattered feathers, a knocked-over drink with melting ice, and a pair of tiny sunglasses that clearly don't fit the roosters. Shadows fall realistically across the scene, and the rich color palette contrasts organic feather textures with hard tile geometry, all rendered in ultra-high resolution from a bird's-eye perspective.
