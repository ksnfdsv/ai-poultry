Create an image depicting a vibrant, surreal scene of two extremely obese roosters joyously celebrating a wine festival in an Olympic-sized swimming pool during a scorching midsummer afternoon. The roosters are adorned with oversized, reflective aviator sunglasses, one with a neon pink frame and the other with a gold frame, each lens showing a distorted reflection of the festival. They are lounging on elaborate, inflatable floats shaped like a flamingo and a unicorn, with the inflatables featuring intricate feather patterns and sparkling gemstone accents.

In the background, a large, ornate bottle of olive oil stands on a mosaic-tiled pool deck, its label written in an ancient, calligraphic script glowing faintly with a golden aura. The pool water shimmers with iridescent ripples, reflecting a sky filled with swirling, Van Gogh-style clouds in vibrant hues of orange, purple, and turquoise. Scattered around the pool are oversized wine glasses filled with sparkling rosé, some floating inexplicably on the water’s surface, emitting a soft, effervescent glow.

Additional festival elements include a garland of grapevines woven with twinkling fairy lights draped around the pool, and a group of anthropomorphic wine bottles dancing in a conga line on a nearby floating platform, each bottle with a unique facial expression and period-specific attire (e.g., Victorian, 1920s flapper, futuristic cyberpunk). A faint mist rises from the pool, infused with the scent of lavender and citrus, visualized as delicate, translucent wisps curling into abstract shapes like musical notes.

The scene is framed by a lush, tropical jungle in the background, with oversized, bioluminescent flowers and vines that pulse gently with light. A surreal touch includes a flock of tiny, mechanical hummingbirds hovering above the roosters, each carrying a miniature wine glass that refracts light into rainbow prisms. The overall atmosphere is chaotic yet harmonious, blending hyper-realistic textures with dreamlike, impossible elements, capturing the essence of a fantastical wine festival.
