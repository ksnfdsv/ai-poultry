Gemini: Here is a description of a card celebrating cherry tree blossom, featuring two fat roosters with very long tails, a bottle of oil, some origami, and a katana, with a funny twist:

A vibrant greeting card bursts with the delicate beauty of cherry blossoms, their soft pink petals raining down. In the foreground, two comically plump roosters with extraordinarily long, flowing tails are the stars of the show. One rooster, with a mischievous glint in his eye, is attempting to trim the other's ridiculously long tail feathers with a gleaming katana, held awkwardly in his wing. The other rooster looks on with a mixture of surprise and mild annoyance. Scattered around their feet are intricate origami figures â€“ a tiny fox with wide eyes and a graceful swan, both appearing to gasp in unison at the unfolding scene. Perched precariously on a cherry blossom branch above them is a half-empty bottle of cooking oil, adding to the general sense of whimsical chaos. The overall impression is one of joyful absurdity, a perfect blend of traditional beauty and unexpected humor.
