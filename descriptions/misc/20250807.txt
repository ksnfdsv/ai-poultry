Create a vibrant, primitivism-style illustration with a pirate theme, featuring two chubby roosters standing on a weathered wooden deck of a pirate ship. The roosters are colorful, with exaggerated feathers and mischievous expressions, one wearing a tiny pirate hat and an eye patch, the other with a bandana. A large, rustic bottle of oil sits between them, glinting in the sunlight, with a worn label and a cork stopper. The background shows a rough sea with simplified, bold waves and a distant island under a bright, blocky sun. Use bold outlines, flat colors, and a raw, textured look to capture the primitivism style.
